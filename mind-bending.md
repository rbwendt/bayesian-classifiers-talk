```
P(fortran developer, given odd) = P(odd, given Fortran developer) * P(fortran developer) / P(odd)
```

Let's substitute in some estimates for these values.

* `P(odd, given fortran developer)`: Let's say 85% of fortran developers are `odd`.
* `P(fortran developer)`: Most developers are `average` and use `react`. Only 1% of
  all developers use Fortran.
* `P(odd)`: Across the whole company, you estimate that 10% of developers are `odd`.
